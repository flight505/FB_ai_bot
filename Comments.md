1. **Greenland is *not* a commodity** – we are a proud Arctic people with a unique culture. We won’t let anyone treat our homeland like a piece of real estate.
   When the U.S. attempted to buy Greenland in 2019, Denmark firmly replied that our land “is not for sale.”

2. **Denmark supports and respects us**, investing in our communities and self-rule instead of exploiting us. The Danish state provides stable funding for education, healthcare, and infrastructure. We won’t trade that for vague promises from a foreign power.
   - **Reference:** [ArcticToday: Greenland’s Stable Relations](https://www.arctictoday.com/greenlands-stable-relations-with-denmark/)

3. **We remember our history**. When foreign superpowers show interest in Greenland, it’s usually for *their* strategic gain – not our benefit. In 1946, the U.S. offered Denmark $100 million in gold to buy Greenland, ignoring our people’s wishes.

4. **Our environment is sacred.** We live in balance with ice, sea, and animals. We fear an outside rush for oil, minerals, or military bases would scar our land and way of life. We’ve seen enough disasters elsewhere to know the risks.

5. **We treasure our freedom** – the freedom to speak our language, hunt and fish as our ancestors did, and govern ourselves locally. As part of the Danish Commonwealth, we have self-government. We won’t swap that for uncertain deals that reduce us to a pawn.
   - **Reference:** [Greenland Self-Government Act](https://www.stm.dk/publikationer/uk_naalakkers/uk_naalakkers.htm)

6. **Greenland’s future lies in partnership, not powerplays.** Denmark and the EU engage with us openly. By contrast, the U.S. often uses heavy-handed tactics on smaller nations. We want friendships, not bribery or coercion.

   - **Reference:** [The Danish Parliament (Folketinget)](https://www.thedanishparliament.dk/en)

13. **Environmental stewardship vs. exploitation:** Denmark and the EU back climate and environmental protections here. The U.S. has rolled back environmental rules repeatedly. We must protect our pristine wilderness.

   - **Reference:** [Nordic Cooperation: Greenland](https://www.norden.org/en/information/greenland)

15. **Pride and dignity:** We are Greenlandic – *Kalaallit Nunaat* – not a piece of “strategic real estate.” We refuse any influence that treats us as a means to an end. With Denmark, we shape our own self-rule.
